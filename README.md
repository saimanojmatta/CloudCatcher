Description:

This repository contains a fully responsive weather application that retrieves current weather data and forecasts based on user input.  Users can enter either a city name or pincode to see details like temperature, humidity, wind, sunrise/sunset times, highs and lows, current date, and local time. The application leverages a weather API (openweathermap.org) and is built with HTML, CSS, and javascript.

Technologies Used:

Nextjs: We utilize Nextjs for building a dynamic and interactive user interface, allowing for efficient data rendering and seamless updates.

Tailwind CSS: We use Tailwind CSS for styling the app, leveraging its utility-first approach to quickly create sleek and modern designs.

OpenWeatherMap API: We leverage the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, including current conditions and forecasts, ensuring reliable and accurate weather information. Temperature unit conversion is handled through the API by specifying the appropriate "units" parameter value ("metric" for Celsius and "imperial" for Fahrenheit), streamlining the implementation process.

Magic UI libarary: allows to design beautiful ui component using framemotion and styling with tailwindcss
